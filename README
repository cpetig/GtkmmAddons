	Gtk--Addons - a set of extensions to gtk[--]

The 'searchcombo' directory contains a new widget which resembles the combo
widget but operates on a dynamically (re)constructed list. Take a look at
the example in 'searchcombo/tests' to get an idea.

The 'src' directory contains some Gtkmm addons, which can be used 
independently: Take them as a bunch of code snippets, feel free to 
use them in your [L]GPL programs.

- Gtkmm_OStream: An ostream implementation for Lists and CLists

- Search_ComboBox: Frontend for a huge database. Selecting initials
	will pop up the list, any unique selection will close it and emit
	a signal. Fully gtkmm-signal driven. Great.

- TCList: A C++ level (interfacing to CList, no new widget) implementation
	of a columned tree, quite similar to CTree but notably different in
	appearance. I prefer this one for database visualizations.

- more_param.h: Additional second user argument for some connect_to_*

- Picture: A simple C++ abstraction for a pixmap, might got irrelevant 
	by recent gnome/gtk development
	
- string_width: determine the length of a string in pixels (very old)

- Message: a simple implementation of a blocking message window

- there are examples for most of these in the 'tests' directory


- documentation might be generated using DOC++
- if you use gnome please ignore Message.h, it's obselete.
- they have been tested with gtkmm 1.0.2, gtk 1.2.3 and egcs 1.1.1
